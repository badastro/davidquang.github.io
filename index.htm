        <h3>David Quang Pham is a scum of the Earth and the Universe. Don’t work with him. He is lucky to have any friend who hears what he has to say. (He has nothing to say) Your life will be miserable. Under little pressure, he caves to pleasing the room and going with the wind. He can’t think for himself. He thinks just because he’s a part of many marginalized communities that he cannot possibly be a toxic individual with any little power that he gets gifted. So wrong. David Quang Pham thinks he is becoming David Henry Hwang but he really became David Mamet. Ew. Except his writing has no substance. It’s all wordplay and puns. He is a poor fish’s definition of a musician and composer. Because he is so bad at separating his imagination and people he’s put on stage, he does not see actors as humans. He needs to do better. His ego is inflated, always bringing up his astrophysics degree that he hasn’t used since graduating. He knows how to code. What could he use that skill for? Animals rescue. An orphanage. NO. He uses that to disparage actors who are just setting their boundaries. He uses his skills and “talents” for EVIL. He may be “nice” at times, but is he good? Well, time will tell.</h3>
